// 👉 First, build and run the program.
//
// To do this, make sure you're in the `exercises` directory, and then run:
//
// gcc -o app2 2.c && ./app2

int main() {
    char *header = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK";
    
    // 👉 Try replacing this `15` with a call to `strlen` (and `#include <string.h>` above!)

    // 👉 After you're using `strlen` above, try adding a `\0` (with the backslash)
    // inside the definition of `header`, e.g.  "HTT\0P/1.1 200 OK" - this inserts
    // a zero byte in the string. Before you run the program, what do you think it will print?

    // 👉 Try changing this `%s` to `%zu` (ignore the compiler warning).

    // 👉 Try changing the `%zud` back to `%s` and then replace the printf call's
    // last argument (originally `header`) with this argument instead: `(char*)123456`
  
    // 👉 Then try it with the number 0 instead of 123456.
